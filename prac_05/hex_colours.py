"""
CP1404/CP5632 Practical
Program that allows user to look up hexadecimal colours.

Use a constant dictionary of about 10 colour names and write a program that allows a user to enter a name and get the code,
e.g., entering AliceBlue (or aliceblue - make it case-independent) should show #f0f8ff.

Entering an invalid colour name should not crash the program.
Allow the user to enter names until they enter a blank one to stop the loop.
