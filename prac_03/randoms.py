# What did you see on line 1?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Not sure what is meant by "what did you see", but the smallest and largest numbers seen were 5 and 20, respectively.

# What did you see on line 2?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Could line 2 have produced a 4?
# The smallest number would likely be 3, with the largest being 9. Producing a 4 is not possible with these instructions as the output (increments of 2) will only produce odd numbers.

# What did you see on line 3?
# What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
# Technically the smallest and largest number that can be printed here would be 2.5 and 5.5 respectively, although the chances of that happening are astronomically low.

# Write code, not a comment, to produce a random number between 1 and 100 inclusive.

import random
print(random.randint(1, 100))
