_Brief information about the repo and myself._ 


Main lessons I have learned about "clean code" in this subject. 
- Consistency is key; mixing different approaches into the same code is confusing for everyone involved.
- Each thing should do one job. That way they're easier to rest, reuse, and change.
- Don’t repeat yourself—factor common steps into tiny functions.
