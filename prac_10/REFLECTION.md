# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimates were somewhat consistent at the beginning of the subject, and honestly I forgot to do
them later on. However, straightforward Python tasks were closer to accurate, but anything involving 
new libraries or debugging usually took longer than expected.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It's hard for me to answer this because again, I forgot to actually make estimates explicitly. However my
overall estimates for 'how long will this practical take' became a lot more accurate toward the later
half of the trimester. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimation is a skill you get better at through practice; that is, practice in making estimates
and practice in learning the skills to complete the tasks. Through both of these I began to get a better
grasp on how long any individual task would take - that is, time needed to debug and the time required to
simply write the program in the first place. 

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed showed me how other people interpret my code, which helped me see unclear naming, 
poor structure, or missing comments that I had overlooked. Reviewers often caught assumptions I made or 
pointed out simpler ways to do something.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others’ code sharpened my ability to spot issues — not just syntax problems, but structure, 
style, consistency, and misuse of SRP. It was also useful to be exposed to the different approaches others
take to solve the same novel problems we were both given. It certainly made me take a second look at my 
code and give some critical thought on how I could have designed or implemented something better.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review 1](https://github.com/Glen20White/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

This review wasn’t highly technical, but it shows that I engaged with another student’s code and 
compared their approach to mine. I highlighted differences in structure and pointed out a couple of 
small improvements - otherwise my review showed that I still lacked understanding in certain areas. 

### Good Code Review 2

[Code Review 2](https://github.com/LucasDummett/cp1404practicals/pull/6#pullrequestreview-3521106463)

### Explanation

In this review I focused on readability and general Python style. While the feedback was simple, 
I still identified areas where variable names or layout could be clearer. The value in this review 
was mostly in participating in the process and showing that I could recognise differences between 
more readable and less readable code.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If this was asked at the beginning of the class, I would say that some creative liberty in how we go about
getting the code to work would be nice. But now that we're at the end, the big picture is far more clear 
with respect to doing things the way we were taught - it's clean and concise, and I've learned valuable
skills that I hope to take with me into the future (despite not being an IT student). It's probably a little
out of the scope of this class, but I would have like to see how we could link this learning into programming
IoT devices, etc. Again, with my learning I think I can now look at this type of thing with more clarity
in my own time. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

As the subject progressed, I became much better at approaching problems in the right way. Early on, 
I often jumped straight into coding without fully understanding the instructions, which made tasks 
harder than they needed to be. Over time, I learned to slow down, read the requirements carefully, and 
follow the structured steps given in the practicals. This shift made my coding smoother and more reliable. 
I also improved in recognising common patterns used throughout the subject.
