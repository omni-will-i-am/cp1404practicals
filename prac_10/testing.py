# (PyCharm may see your >>> doctest comments and run doctests anyway.) # It definitely does
# doctest.testmod()

# 4. Fix the failing is_long_word function
# (Don't change the tests, change the function!)

# 5. Write and test a function to format a phrase as a sentence,
# starting with a capital and ending with a single full stop.
# Important: start with a function header and just use pass as the body
# then add doctests for 3 tests:
#   'hello' -> 'Hello.'
#   'It is an ex parrot.' -> 'It is an ex parrot.'
# and one more that you decide is a useful test.
# Run your doctests and watch the tests fail.
# Then write the body of the function so that the tests pass.
