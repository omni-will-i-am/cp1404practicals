# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

75%

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

None so far. However I plan to watch them on Tuesdays following my on campus lecture, either at JCU or at home.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

It's strange but for my other classes (Science / Biomed) I often try to consider how I would write a given biological or pharmacological process in terms of python code. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to commit more time to simply just practicing different aspects of python and aim to complete the work gradually throughout the week.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Not following the processes that we are being taught and spending too much time looking at third party solutions when the answers I seek are provided in the content shared by Lindsay. 

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Not sure. I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of python again but it's been a while; I just need to keep putting the time in.
