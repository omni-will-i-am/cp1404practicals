# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've spent more time working with the course content and understanding the methods by which we are expected to follow. 
Particularly that of ensuring that my submission meet the standards expected of me (as much as I can, at least)

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I think that I definitely need to just think about my approaches to problems more, but otherwise I think I'm at least moving in the right direction.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

"Doing well" is hard to qualify, but I certainly feel like I'm gaining a better understanding of good coding practices and the language in general; which is really what I wanted from this course.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should aim to spread my watching of lecture content out more, rather than trying to do it all in one sitting as I definitely get distracted after some amount of time.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I'm not an IT student, and I feel like I'm getting what I expected from this class so far. The reason for doing this class is to gain a better understanding of how to approach designing electronic devices (i.e., with Arduino's IDE or Raspberry pi)
